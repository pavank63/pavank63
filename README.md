# Pavan Kalyan Reddy Cherupally

I'm Pavan Kalyan Reddy Cherupally, a software engineer with a strong background in computer science and electronics. Right now, I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Arizona State University. Over the years, I've picked up a wide range of skills in programming languages like C++, Python, and Java, and I've worked with various technologies and frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Kubernetes. My professional journey includes significant experience at BrowserStack, where I led projects to boost system performance, cut down infrastructure costs, and improve compatibility across different platforms.

I've always enjoyed working on both software development and data platform engineering. At BrowserStack, I played a key role in shifting from monolithic systems to Kubernetes-based microservices, set up feature flagging for smoother releases, and developed a platform that reduced infrastructure expenses. My time as a research assistant at IIIT Hyderabad was equally rewardingâ€”I worked on machine learning models that made accurate predictions and wrote papers on AI/ML applications in VLSI design. Whether it's in academics or hands-on projects, I'm passionate about using my skills to create impactful solutions and drive technological progress.
